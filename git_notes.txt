Pull requests are how you merge branches on github.

Github is a hub of .git/ directories

You can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories.

You can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths.

master branch is a label that git creates for us when we intilize our repository

HEAD is another label that git creats for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is not a branch

# creates a new branch (lable) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch
